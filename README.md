## Introduction
**Process models** is a subject of the Degree Computer Engineering studied in University of Lleida.
This is the repository of the project of this subject.

The idea of our project is to create a web application that allows users to view academies and/or establishments where all kinds of extra-school activities are performed together with all the courses they are currently offering to choose the one that suits their children most and enroll them in the courses. In addition, it will also allow the viewing of written reviews (commentaries) by other users who have previously enrolled their children in courses and their rating scores from 1 to 5 stars.
